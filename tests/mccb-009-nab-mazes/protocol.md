# NAB Mazes Administration and Scoring Protocol

## Materials Required
- NAB Mazes stimulus booklet
- Response sheets
- Pen or pencil
- Stopwatch or timer
- Quiet testing environment

## Administration Procedure

### Preparation
1. Ensure the testing environment is free from distractions
2. Position participant at comfortable distance from stimulus materials
3. Have all materials readily accessible

### Instructions
**Standard Instructions to Participant:**
"Today you'll be completing some maze puzzles. Your task is to find the correct path from the start point (marked with 'S') to the exit point (marked with 'E'). Please follow these rules:

1. Draw a continuous line from start to exit
2. Do not lift your writing instrument from the paper
3. Do not retrace any part of your path
4. Work as quickly and accurately as possible
5. You will have a time limit for each maze

Do you have any questions before we begin?"

### Test Administration

#### Maze 1 (Practice)
- **Time Limit**: 2 minutes
- **Purpose**: Ensure understanding of task requirements
- **Scoring**: Not included in total score
- **Feedback**: Provide correction if rules are violated

#### Mazes 2-8 (Test Items)
- **Time Limits**: 
  - Mazes 2-4: 3 minutes each
  - Mazes 5-6: 4 minutes each  
  - Mazes 7-8: 5 minutes each
- **Procedure**: 
  1. Present maze stimulus
  2. Start timer simultaneously with maze presentation
  3. Monitor for rule violations
  4. Stop participant when time limit reached or maze completed
  5. Record completion status and time

## Scoring Guidelines

### Primary Scoring
**Correct Completion**: 1 point per maze completed correctly within time limit
- Maximum possible score: 7 points (Mazes 2-8)
- Maze 1 is practice and not scored

### Secondary Measures
1. **Completion Time**: Record exact time (in seconds) for each completed maze
2. **Error Types**:
   - Rule violations (lifting pen, retracing)
   - Wrong path taken
   - Incomplete within time limit

### Scoring Rules
- **Correct**: Complete path from S to E following all rules within time limit
- **Incorrect**: Any rule violation, wrong path, or time expiration
- **Partial Credit**: Not awarded - maze is either correct or incorrect

## Behavioral Observations
Record qualitative observations during testing:

### Strategy Use
- **Planning**: Does participant scan entire maze before starting?
- **Method**: Systematic vs. random approach
- **Corrections**: Self-monitoring and error correction

### Executive Function Indicators
- **Impulsivity**: Starting without planning
- **Perseveration**: Continuing with incorrect strategy
- **Flexibility**: Changing strategies when needed

### Frustration Tolerance
- Verbal expressions of frustration
- Physical signs of stress
- Motivation level throughout test

## Standardized Scoring

### Raw Score Conversion
Convert raw scores (0-7) to standardized scores using age-appropriate normative tables:

**Age Groups:**
- 18-29 years
- 30-39 years  
- 40-49 years
- 50-59 years
- 60-69 years
- 70+ years

**Score Interpretation:**
- **Above Average**: > 85th percentile
- **Average**: 16th-84th percentile
- **Below Average**: < 16th percentile

## Clinical Considerations

### Factors That May Influence Performance
- Visual acuity problems
- Motor difficulties affecting drawing
- Attention deficits
- Test anxiety
- Cultural/educational background

### Accommodations
- Extended time (document reason)
- Adapted writing utensils
- Larger maze formats
- Breaks between items (if needed)

## Quality Assurance

### Administration Checks
- [ ] Instructions delivered clearly
- [ ] Time limits enforced consistently
- [ ] All materials present and correct
- [ ] Environment free from distractions

### Scoring Verification
- [ ] Raw scores calculated correctly
- [ ] Times recorded accurately
- [ ] Behavioral observations documented
- [ ] Standardized scores applied appropriately

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Participant doesn't understand rules**: Use practice maze for demonstration
2. **Exceeds time limits**: Stop immediately and mark as incomplete
3. **Lifts pen accidentally**: Mark as rule violation, continue if possible
4. **Visual difficulties**: Consider accommodations or alternative assessment

### Test Discontinuation Criteria
- Inability to understand task after practice trial
- Excessive frustration or anxiety
- Physical limitations preventing completion
- Administrative errors affecting validity

## Documentation Requirements
- Date and time of administration
- Administrator name/credentials
- Raw scores and completion times
- Standardized scores with percentile ranks
- Behavioral observations
- Any accommodations provided
- Test validity notes
